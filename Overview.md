<h1> Product Brief: Piazza Panic </h1>
<p> we were tasked to build a single-player game that requires managing the staff around a kitchen, who  <br>
will be preparing various dishes requested by customers coming into the Piazza Restaurant. <br>
<h4>Specific features include:</h4>
<p>  You will switch between three cooks, controlling one at a time by instructing them
where to go, and helping them prepare each dish. Your control scheme should allow
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Switching between cooks</li>
  <li> Moving the cooks</li>
  <li> Interacting with whatâ€™s in front of the cook (chop / flip / grab an ingredient or dish / place what they are carrying)</li>
</ul>
