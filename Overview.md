<h1> Product Brief: Piazza Panic </h1>
<p> we were tasked to build a single-player game that requires managing the staff around a kitchen, who will be preparing various dishes requested by customers coming into the Piazza Restaurant. <br>
<h4>Specific features include:</h4>
<p>  You will switch between three cooks, controlling one at a time by instructing them
where to go, and helping them prepare each dish. Your control scheme should allow
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Switching between cooks</li>
  <li> Moving the cooks</li>
  <li> Interacting with what’s in front of the cook (chop / flip / grab an ingredient or dish / place what they are carrying)</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers will arrive at different intervals, demanding to be served a recipe within a given time limit.</p>
<p>  Two game modes will be supported: </p>  
<ul>
  <li>  A “scenario” mode with a configurable number of customers to be served (default to 5).</li>
  <li>An "endless" mode where customers will keep arriving more and more often until you lose.</li>
</ul>
<p>  Each recipe will require different preparation steps at different "cooking stations"</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Each preparation step will require the player to take control of the staff member at certain points in time (e.g. flipping a patty so it doesn't burn, or cutting the vegetables for the salad).</li>
  <li>If they fail the preparation step (e.g. the patty is burnt or the vegetables are not cut well), they will have to repeat the step.</li>
<ul>
<p> There should be recipes at least for salad, burgers, pizzas, and jacket potatoes. For the first two, here are example recipes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Salad: cut lettuce, cut tomatoes, cut onions, serve together.</li>
  <li> Burger: form patty, fry patty, toast buns, serve together.</li>
<p>  There should be cooking stations for cutting, baking, frying, and serving.</p>
<p>  There should be a pantry with “ingredient stations”:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Cooks can interact with an ingredient station to add an ingredient to the top of the stack they carry.
  <li> Cooks carrying ingredients can then interact with a cooking station to drop their top ingredient on it.
  <li>Ingredients never run out.</li>
</ul>
